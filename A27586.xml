            <title>A Catholick catechism shewing the impossibility the Catholick religion should be varied to the degree of a thought, from the measures left sealed by the apostles, without the loss of truth, and therefore the impossibility popery, or whatever else is not found in Scripture, should be Catholick : composed to the capacity of the meanest that will but consider, that they may know and be ready upon unmovable reasons, to give an apologie or defensive answer for the Catholick religion, if they are indeed of it, and be secured from temptation in times of danger.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Call this <hi>A Catechiſm,</hi> becauſe I deſign it a Familiar Inſtruction in Fundamental Truths, Reſounding the ſame Thing from Queſtion to Anſwer; the eaſieſt way of Conveying Truth, and Imprinting it upon the Minds of thoſe that are even of the meaneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: But eſpecially, becauſe the Principles of it are to be daily ſo Meditated upon, Pondered and Applyed to uſe, as to be a perpetual ſound in our Ears, and ſo to be properly ſtiled <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</hi>

                  </gap>eep, they may keep us; that when we wake, they may talk with us,</hi> Prov. 6. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>I know the Things I have written cannot be duely received without much Thinking, and without that they will be in danger of a Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rejection from the moſt, or of a ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unintelligent Acceptance in the Kinder; which is as bad as the other, and therefore I preſent it as a <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> to thoſe that ſhall at all approve it, that they may be throughly verſed in it, and the Senſe of it grow Domeſtick to them.</p>
            <p>I call it a <hi>Catholick Catechiſm,</hi> only with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Great Subjects it Treats of, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in thoſe things wherein they are <hi>Catholick;</hi> or in which their <hi>Catholickneſs</hi> conſiſt: That is, that they are of God, and that the whole Society of Holy and Happy Spirits is by that <hi>Catholickneſs</hi> united, and cloſely banded with it ſelf. <hi>Catholick,</hi> as the Epiſtles called <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is, after ſome Doubt Aſſerted to be Divine, of the Publick Spirit of God, and giving that Publick Doctrine, in which the General Aſſembly is one.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105087:3"/>
            <p> I have endeavoured to contrive the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers ſo, that the Anſwers may be an <hi>Apology,</hi> or Defenſive Anſwer of that <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> giving a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or a <hi>Rational Account,</hi> to any Demand that can be made upon it: And it is the <hi>Apology</hi> of that Truth it ſelf; the <hi>Apology</hi> it gives and furniſhes us with, for other can no Man give: Truth can need no other, than its <hi>Native Apology</hi> for it ſelf; no other will it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
            <p>To give this, and to be always ready to give it, to keep it within us, and to have it fitted to our Lips, is the proper Fruit of ſuch a <hi>Catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruction;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> aſſures us, it is the great Duty of Chriſtianity, and the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we can do to God, Firſt to <hi>Sanctifie him in our Hearts, by a full acknowledgment of him in his Divine Truth,</hi> by a <hi>Plerophory, or full Aſſurance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the Myſtery of God, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Chriſt.</hi> For a Devotion to the True God, without knowing him to be the True God, cannot thus Sanctifie or Honour him.</p>
            <p>There is nothing we ſhould be more Rational in, than in the True Religion, the Account of which, and of its whole Content, ought to be ſo certain to us, that nothing of a Diverſe Spirit from it, can be added to it; nor any thing of its Integral or Eſſential Nature taken from it; but
<pb facs="tcp:105087:4"/> we may plainly ſee, it would change the Account; and ſo we need not make a Traverſe over all Falſehood to know Truth, but by having a Right underſtanding in, and Juſt Contemplation of Truth, the moſt even thing in the whole World; we come to know it ſelf, by it ſelf, and to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of it, although there were no other Falſe Religion in the World to compare it with, and ſet it off by, and withal to deſcry <hi>every falſe way</hi> offered to us, and to <hi>hate it:</hi> Yea we obſerve every thing that is but doubtfully Propoſed, and ſtay it its due time of Examination, and ſo either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or reject it, or if we ſee full reaſon for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill ſuſpend.</p>
            <p>It is not the Laws of our Country, our Church, our being Baptiz'd, or Educated in it, that will juſtifie our Religion to be the True: It is not the High Reverence of it, the Devotion we uſe in it, our hating of thoſe that ſpeak Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly of it, will make good our Religion, what Religion in the World may not be juſtified upon ſuch Topicks? It is not that we find many great Principles of Truth in a Religion, that will juſtifie it: There is no Religion, that can be called Religion, that does not eſpouſe many True Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And in Chriſtian Religion, Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm vies with Chriſtianity it ſelf upon the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Creeds, which it ſelf Confeſſes with True
<pb facs="tcp:105087:4"/> Chriſtianity, but hath Built upon them New Creeds of its own, and ſo Corrupted all: For what is ſo pure, and perfect, as True Religion is, muſt needs be Corrupted by any Addition: All that is Pure and True, is already its own; who then can add to it, and not be found a Lyar?</p>
            <p>Nothing therefore, as I have already intimated, can be our ſecurity for True Religion, but the <hi>Juſt Divine Meaſure,</hi> the <hi>Common Faith,</hi> the <hi>True Catholick Standard,</hi> which in all things neceſſary to the main End, is moſt evident, and in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing that is not ſo evident, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo upon this Great Teſt, this is our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
            <p>For it is very plain, there is leſs danger when our Underſtandings are not yet extended to the breadth of Divine Truth, (if none of the Vital Principles are unknown to us, unſenſed by us, which are ſo exceedingly plain, that we cannot be, except willfully, ignorant of them,) for no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is done to Truth, that we do not underſtand its whole Compaſs; nor to our ſelves, if we do not hate knowledge, offering it ſelf to our notices, but in adding to Truth, ſeeing we can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to add, but what is of no worth, we muſt needs defile it; in having only Truth, though we have not all Truth, we yet are under the Influence of Truth only, but when we add,
<pb facs="tcp:105087:5"/> we enſlave our ſelves to <hi>Lying Vanities:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hereunto have I levelled the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or Diſcourſe; againſt which I know many prejudices will lie, except full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration be allowed: I know too many things raiſe a Deteſtation at the firſt, which being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and Weighed by their Reaſon, gain not only the Diſcharge of theſe Angry Paſſions, but much Acceptance and Aſſent: And I muſt take the Confidence to ſay, in relation to any ſuch Doubt upon the enſuing <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> that it is ſettled upon ſuch unmoveable Reaſon, and Weigh'd out by ſuch exact atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to it, that I may write upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Immodeſty; <hi>Loe this, we have ſearched it, ſo it is, hear it, and know thou it for thy good;</hi> for good in the Quiet and moſt Peaceable Courſe of Chriſtianity, wherein to know the True Grounds upon which it reſts, alone makes the Soul both Wiſe and Good, and determines it to the Square and Juſt Rules of that Holy Religion; for Good in times of Temptation to a Falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eſpecially that which calls it ſelf <hi>Catholick.</hi> For the truly Inſtructed Chriſtian, in that which is indeed <hi>Catholick,</hi> is even Impregnable againſt that Deluſion of <hi>Catholick, falſely ſo called;</hi> Laſtly, for good, in the midſt of great Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Diverſities of Opinion and Practice, in
<pb facs="tcp:105087:5"/> relation to leſſer things, pertaining more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially, or Doubtfully to True Religion, wherein the Rational Chriſtian carrying it as Inoffenſively and Communicatively as he can with all, centers in that which is <hi>Catholick,</hi> as to his Faith, Love, Inward Eſteem, and Practice, and unmoveably fixes there, deteſting all Animoſity, and much more rigour or ſeverity towards others in Relation to ſuch differences, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more ungenerous, more unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, more irreligious, more unworthy.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Holy Scriptures; All Scripture is given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Correction in Righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work.

                  <p>For he looked upon all things that he had made, and behold all was good, and very good: And he appointed a Sabbatiſm for all his Creatures, and eſpecially his Rational Creatures, the Morning Stars, to ſing together, and praiſe him for them.</p>

Many great Truths, and undoubtedly Divine in themſelves, that, being more at a diſtance from thoſe that are neceſſary to Salvation, it hath not pleaſed the Publick Wiſdom of the World to give ſuch Aſſurance of them, as that they ſhould be impoſed upon the Belief of all that acknowledge the Sacred Authority of Scriptures, and yet may preſent very large Satisfactions to the Minds of thoſe who are aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit, into the great Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Reaſon, in ſuch Points, though but particularly for themſelves: They may then <hi>taſte the Graciouſneſs of God,</hi> and the Gratefulneſs of Truth in them, without impoſing on any others, who cannot ſee by their Light.</p>

Yea, even in things controverted between Holy, Wiſe, and Good Men, in Interpreting Scripture, each part of the Controverſie, when both cannot be reconciled in their Senſe, yet ſupports and makes ſtronger to their Faith ſome grand, evident Principles of Divine and Publick Truth, in which both Sides meet, and are firmly united, and to which each reconcile their own Opinions, wherein they

Heaven is my Throne, Earth is my Footſtool; where is the Houſe you will build me? To this Man will I look, that trembles at my Word.</hi> And where God dwells, there he manifeſts himſelf: As a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Family makes known in his Houſe and Family his Nature, Will, Laws, and Government; ſo God does in his Church: <hi>In</hi> Judah <hi>is God known, his Name is great in</hi> Iſrael. In his Church he ſhews <hi>the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> expects and rewards Services, as a Great Maſter, and makes known his Diſlikes and Diſpleaſure. This is brought to paſs in the Church by thoſe many Ways that God hath of bringing his Word to any Places or Perſons, giving it Reception among them, and then ſtirring up his Children and Servants to hear his Voice, to ſearch his Mind and Will, and to underſtand it; ſo that it is as a Voice continually behind them. In his Temple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his Houſe, every one muſt needs ſpeak of his Glory: His Word cannot lie ſtill, for all are concerned to meditate, ponder, inquire, and diſcourſe of it, and are by Supreme Management excited ſo to do; and ſo much as this Exerciſe in his Word is by any means depreſſed, ſo far God is withdrawn, and the Excellency of the Church-ſtate loſt.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath by the <hi>Key of Knowledge</hi> inquir'd into all the Divine and Heavenly Doctrine of the Goſpel and Word of God, it hath in and according to that Word, and only ſo, a Power of Application of that Doctrine to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes, binding Men under the Senſe of Guilt, and fear of Damnation, in ſuch or ſuch Sins, and an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Continuance in them; or of Abſolving, and aſſuring Men of the Divine Favour and Acceptance, in a holy courſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105087:48"/> of Life, and Obedience to God, and of Pardon upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, after Falls into Sin, and Diſobedience; and ſo of Declaring and Pronouncing upon Men, as to their preſent State in the Church, by Excommunication, or Abſolution; all theſe are the Power of <hi>Binding and Looſing;</hi> according to what our Saviour ſpeaks in parallel Words, <hi>Whoſe Sins you remit, they are remitted; whoſe Sins you retain, they are retained;</hi> meaning ſtill according to his Word, the Pole-Star by which they are to direct all their Motions, who claim any ſuch Power: For, only where it is declard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word, is it, that <hi>what is bound on Earth, is alſo bound in Heaven; and what is looſed on Earth, is looſed in Heaven;</hi> there being an Invariable Agreement between what is Publiſhed from Heaven, in the Word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State and Actions of Men on Earth, and the Tranſactions in Heaven, in relation to them. He then that pronounces agreeably with that word, pronounces as Heaven does and will pronounce; Heaven binds what he binds, and looſes what he looſes, becauſe he ſpeaks the Voice of Heaven in both Caſes.</p>
                  <p>But that there ſhould be any Binding or Looſing, except in the Power of this Word, and according to it, in its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in its Truth, nothing can be more contrary to the Ends, to the Glory, to the Soveraignty of Chriſt.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides all other Coincident Accounts, there is this to be given. After the Apoſtles, there was but a Gradual Ceſſation of Apoſtolick Men, Men of Eminent Graces and Extraordinary Gifts, though not of the Infallible Guidance of the Divine Spirit for the Revelation of the Goſpel, or the writing of Scripture; yet of more immediate Divine Aſſiſtances, in reſemblance of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the Confirmation of the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, Superviſal over them, and Care for them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the further propagation of Chriſtianity, which being but newly ſet out, had not arrived many places, where it was to come, and ſo needed ſome more than ordinary Aſſiſtances: Even as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did not immediately Ceaſe, no more did theſe Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges extraordinary in their Endowments: Such as theſe were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in a Degree of Superiority over thoſe that had not the ſame miraculous Inablements, nor Knowledge as yet in Chriſtianity. Afterwards ſuch Manifeſtations of the Divine Preſence by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees retiring, and Chriſtianity having fixed it ſelf where it was then to go, and the Churches ſettled, the beſt accounts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Diſtinction between thoſe that were upon the ſame level, in regard of their Gifts and Graces were but Humane Prudence and Order, which oblige no Man's Conſcience beyond the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Reaſons of that Prudence and Order. Except un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Holineſs, Induſtry, and Improv'd Underſtanding recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any Perſon to ſuch Eminency. For Eminency, and being Taller than others in thoſe Qualifications, will make any Perſon a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in the true ſenſe of one, whether ſo ordinated or not; and cannot make him that is a Dwarf in theſe, truly a Biſhop; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for Orders ſake he may ſtand in the place of that Figure.</p>
                  <p>He that excels in his Knowledge of, Obedience to, Zeal for, and Authority in the Word of God, ſeeing that Word conveys all this kind of Power from it ſelf, muſt needs have more of that kind of Power ſo conveyed than others; for the more purely this Word is underſtood and Preached, the more Power goes out of it, and along with thoſe that diſplay it, and ſo they become Paſtors of a higher Character, whether of a higher Order, or not.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better be underſtood, I will ſet before you the ſeveral Inſtances of Schiſm in Scripture, and the Evils noted by the Apoſtle in each of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt ſort of Schiſm, is the Diſunion in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Doctrine of the Goſpel, and bringing in upon it the neceſſity of the Judaique Rites to concur with it: This the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. calls making Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Parties, beſide, or contrary to the Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: The great Evil of this adding to the Word of God, is, that it lays Scandals before Men, and draws them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this great miſchief, that inſtead of the pure nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Truth, all runs into this over-beloved Sentiment, and ſo deprives the Soul of the true and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirits of Truth; and alſo the Service due to True Chriſtianity is drain'd away, and conſumed upon this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion, which is indeed the miſchief of all Falſhood in Religion, and Devotion in Things not appointed by God, who only can preſcribe what is truly fitted to our Good, and bleſs it with ſuitable Effect: Miſcarriage from Divine Truth is always found in Schiſm, with this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Conſequence, that it deceives the Soul with a Cloud and Wind, inſtead of Truth and ſolid Good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second kind of Schiſm the Apoſtle Notes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19, 20. was the Diſorder in Divine-Worſhip, in that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105087:56"/> great Ordinance of the Lords Supper, wherein they that were reprov'd were neceſſitated to withdraw, and to ſtand apart for the manifeſting themſelves in the purity of that Worſhip and Service, for the very honor of it. The great Evil of this Schiſm is, that it brings in a neceſſity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Parties in Publick Religion, and the Duties of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Men muſt ſeparate from ſuch Corruptions, and ſtand at a Diſtance from them, on Account of which Religion it ſelf is diſhonoured, as if it were a Jumble of Sects, and gave an uncertain ſound; and further than that, is charged, as if it were but a Sect it ſelf, becauſe it ſtands by it ſelf: Thus Chriſtianity was called, <hi>This Sect,</hi> and the <hi>Sect of the</hi> Nazarenes: Idolatry damns the True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, as a Hereſie from it ſelf, and the Falſe Church charges the truly Publick-Aſſembly with Schiſm, and a Private Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Degree of Schiſm the Apoſtle taxes in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>c.</hi> 4. 3. was, that this one intire Profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the one Univerſal Church of Chriſt, they thought, ought to be ſhred into little Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities, under the Names of ſome prime Miniſter of Chriſtianity, or even under the Name of Chriſt himſelf, as an ordinary Maſter of a Party, except we will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that, Thoſe Approved, who ſtood firm in Chriſt alone, were manifeſted, and ſtood alone, by being at a diſtance from the Schiſm of others, and ſo appeared, as was ſaid before, like a Schiſm themſelves.

                  <p>As then Number and Meaſure are means Ordained for Humane Nature, and principal Inſtruments of Reaſon, to come to the moſt certain knowledge of things, and to be ſecured, they are, and continue what they juſtly ought to be; ſo True Religion is thereupon preſented to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exact Number and Meaſure, falling in one with another, the Number Twelve multiplied into a Square Cube of Twelve thouſand Furlongs.</p>
                  <p>And as the Fourſquare Figure does ſo bind, and is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with it ſelf, that it cannot receive the leaſt Addition, but with the loſs of its Square, nor the leaſt Diminution, but under the ſame Forfeiture; thus True Religion is ſo perfectly it ſelf, that it can neither be added to, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed from, but with a proportionable loſs of it ſelf: God was pleaſed upon this account to chuſe this Figure for the Altar under the Law, for the Breaſt-Plate of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this was the Meaſure of <hi>Solomons</hi> Oracle, how far the Meaſures in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> agree, I leave.

                  <p>And laſtly, as Solid Square Meaſure is in all parts of it, and throughout every part, exactly Square, and gives the moſt certain account of the whole content of a Body; ſo is True Religion in all its Parts exactly ſo it ſelf, and every Part of every Part is reduced to the ſame exactneſs; for ſo the Length, Bredth and Height of it are equal, and ſo is the True Church exactly adequated to True Religion: The Faith is therefore ſaid to be at once delivered to the

                  <p n="1">1. The Tranſcendant Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Purity of the Doctrine, Precepts of Worſhip, Rules of Life, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, is one ſide of this Chriſtian-ſquare, with which whatever does not Square, is convicted not to be of that Doctrine and Religion; whether it look towards God, in all the Higheſt, moſt Honourable Apprehenſions of him, ſuitable Diſcourſe, Worſhip, Love and Obedience; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it look towards Men, in all Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, Compaſſion, Charity, Benevolence, Beneficence; and theſe, as they reſpect all the particular Offices of Life; Publick, of Magiſtrates, Subjects; or Private, as of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children; Husband, Wife; Maſter or Servants: The Peace and Welfare of Mankind are treaſur'd up in the Law of Chriſt; or laſtly, whether it look to a Mans own Perſon, in Soberneſs, Purity, Continency in the Thoughts, the Words, the Actions. The Honour and beſt State of the Mind and Body are provided for by this Doctrine that is after Godlineſs, not only in the World to come, but in this Life: Whatever now does not agree
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105087:68"/> with theſe wholeſom words, is detected not to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; which is all Truth, Virtue, and Praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There being nothing more intimate to Man, in this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtate, than the Senſe of Guilt, and knowledg that he is a Sinner, the whole platform of Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt is become like the Original Law of Righteouſneſs, by which Man was formed, and Anſwers to it in all the Attributes of Perfection; as therefore the Plot of Reſtoration by the Son of God infolds it within it ſelf, and anſwers every way exactly to it, ſo that very Law and Doctrine of Holineſs owns the Reconciliation and Attonement by that great Sacrifice, as Equilateral to it ſelf, the Dimenſions of one being found correſpondent in the other, and each to be Tryed one by the other; ſo great a Sacrifice would be unneceſſary, if it had not ſo great a Law to anſwer; ſo great a Law can be anſwered by ſo great a Sacrifice, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that: It muſt have that; it can need, it can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other. So then, the one may be Meaſured by the other: The Holineſs, Purity of ſuch a Law violated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch an Effectual Pacification, and Purgation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch a Renovation as Chriſtianity ſets before us. Such a Sacrifice, ſuch a Renovation or Sanctification by the Divine Spirit from it, teaches us, what an excellent Law was violated; ſo often therefore is the <hi>Lamb</hi> made the Title of our Lord and Savour, ſo often it is Signally Recorded in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and the Names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>of the Lamb</hi> are ſaid to be written in the Foundations of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſhew the weight of the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Sacrifice in the Blood of Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit breathing in and from it, in Renovation and Sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Liberty that Jeſus Chriſt hath brought in by his Goſpel, is another Equilateral Character of his True Religion, to be Meaſured by each of the former, and it alſo Meaſures them: It is not a Liberty from Holineſs, it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105087:69"/> is not a Liberty from cloſe application to the Redemption of Chriſt, and not to need it, on any pretence whatever; but it is a Liberty from any Impoſition that is Ceremonial, and does not by its Intrinſique Worth and Goodneſs, or by its Supreme Ordination from God, center in the true Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Mind, Conſcience, and whole Soul: yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God himſelf had Commanded the <hi>Jews,</hi> is not only reverſed, but deſpiſed for the ſake of Chriſtian Liberty, if it does not ſquare with it, ſo that no Yoak of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Bondage is laid upon us by God himſelf; that which <hi>had been,</hi> is taken away, and a Yoak of humane impoſiing is under the <hi>Goſpel-Anathema:</hi> the Doctrine of Godlineſs, of Redemption by Chriſt, may be juſtly meaſured by the true perfection of Conſcience. To do well in things intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically good, according to the Rule of Chriſtianity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly purg'd and atton'd by the Chriſtian Sacrifice, do alſo truly meaſure this Liberty: for on one ſide, <hi>the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. He that in theſe things ſerves Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men:</hi> It is not applying to <hi>the Blood of Bulls and Goats, that can never take away ſin,</hi> but <hi>to the Blood Offered by the Eternal Spirit, which certainly makes the comers thereunto perfect:</hi> On the other ſide, this Liberty lays not open the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a Holy Life, nor removes the Barriers of Juſtice againſt Sin, if not ſatisfied and attoned by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, That which anſwers to each of theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of True Religion, is, that it hath no Secular Intereſt, no Intereſt of this preſent World, <hi>that it looks not upon the things that are ſeen, that are but for a Moment, but on the things that are not ſeen, that are Eternal;</hi> ſuch is the Godlineſs, ſuch is the Sacrifice, ſuch the Chriſtian Liberty, that their Uſes and Ends are too great and large to center in Earthly things; and though themſelves are the True In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105087:69"/> of the preſent ſtate, yet they no way make it, or the Grandeur of it, an Intereſt, but ſeek a Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and City; even as the Lord of this Religion ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> Now as this meaſures each of the other Characters, ſo each of them meaſures it; ſuch a Tranſcendant Holineſs and Purity can alone ſee God in Eternal Habitations; ſuch a Sacrifice alone can have its Blood enter into the Holy Place made without Hands, having obtained an Eternal Inheritance; ſuch a Blood ſpeaks alone in the Heavens, <hi>better things than the Blood of Abel;</hi> a Conſcience ſo free, ſo perfected, hath boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt, and none elſe: Theſe are all fitted and Conſecrated to Eternity, and Eternity to them; Light and trivial Holineſs, Inſignificant Ceremonies, and Rites of Purgation; a cumber of External Obſervations, invented by Men, can never enter within the Vail, nor endure for ever. And on the other ſide, by ſuch Divine Things to graſp at this World, and a Patrimony on Earth, is as groſs and out of Square; ſo that theſe things exactly meaſure one another, and ſquare together.</p>

                  <p>But there is this difference between Natural and Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religion; Natural Religion is written in the Heart, and may certainly be found there, (however it comes to be known, clearly, and truly, only by Revelation) and ſo may be abſolutely Commanded: But Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The True Religion of the Word of God in a Nation, or City, does overtop all the Falſe and Private Religions in it, and become in the Sacred Regiſter, the National Religion.

Without the Change of True Religion it ſelf, there cannot be a Schiſm of a deeper Senſe in it; if Bitterneſs and Animoſity, Cenſoriouſneſs, and the Perſecuting Spirit were away: God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly Interpret Scruples on one ſide to a Jealouſie for the Purity of Religion, the freedom of the other to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Propagate it under the favour of Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be capable of doing moſt Good.
