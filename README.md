1. A Catholick Catechiſm,

    _ CAP. I. Of the Perfect and Firſt State of Humane Nature, with relation to Catholick, or Publick Religion.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. II. Of the Violation of this Catholick Order of Religion, and the Means provided by God to reſtore it.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. III. Of the Uncontroverſible Laws of Natural Religion.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. IV. Of Revelation, and the Reaſons of ſo great Miſcarriages againſt both the Light of Nature and Revelation, with the Means of Cure.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. V. Of the Publick or Divine Original of Sacred Writing, or Scripture.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. VI. Of the Proof of Scripture, That it is of God; and that the Proof alſo is Publick and Divine.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. VII. Of the Publick Interpretation of Scripture.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. VIII. Of Tradition and Antiquity.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. IX. Of the Church-Catholick.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. X. Of the Officers appointed by Chriſt in his Church.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. XI. Of every Man's Obligation to be wiſe for himſelf to Salvation.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. XII. Of Schiſm and Scandal.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. XIII. Of the Anti-Church, and its Oppoſition in every Thing to the True Church.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this 
    _ CAP. XIV. Of the Power of Magiſtrates, in Religion, and of National Religion.
Queſt. WHAT is the moſt diſtinguiſhing Excellency and Perfection of Humane Nature?Anſw. Catholick, oQueſt. What do you mean by Religion?Anſw. By Religion I mean a cloſe Binding, or Uniting our ſelves Queſt. Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Religion?Anſw. Becauſe God, to whom we properlQueſt. Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?Anſw. From theQueſt. How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?Anſw. Idiotick Queſt. What Evidence of this is there?Anſw. It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoever conſide
      * Queſt. What are the Records God hath vouchſafed to men, of this Catholick, Publick Religion?
Queſt. Which is the ſecond Record?Anſw. The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collected into Holy SQueſt. I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heQueſt. But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he contiQueſt. What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?Anſw. It is therefoQueſt. You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid bQueſt. What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?Anſw. God, the Univerſal Queſt. HOw did a change begin in this Catholick State of Religion, in the place of which we now ſee Queſt. How did this affect Man?Anſw. They immediately endeavoured upon Humane Natures being newly brQueſt. With what appearance was ſo malicious an Attempt covered?Anſw. Under the plauſible Diſguiſe oQueſt. What was the miſchievous Deſign that lay hid under this?Anſw. To have enſlav'd Humane Nature Queſt. What was the Effect of this Helliſh Attempt?Anſw. Too unhappily ſucceſsful it was; for drawinQueſt. What was the diſmal Conſequence of ſo monſtrous a Seduction?Anſw. They loſt their place in thQueſt. But did theſe Excommunicate Spirits prevail upon our Firſt Parents, to become abſolutely and Queſt. What were the Foundations laid by the Son of God, the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them Queſt. Who is the Supreme Superintendent, miſſioned or ſent in the Son's Name, to negotiate our RetuQueſt. You have made no mention of Creation, Providence, Evidences of Divine Preſence, and Miracles,Queſt. How ſhall there be a Diſtinction betwixt Miracles and Lying Wonders that impoſe on Men?Anſw. Queſt. THere having been ſo much of Account given in general of Publick and Catholick Religion, ſhewQueſt. How then ſhall we make a Judgment, what is written upon the Heart?Anſw. That which is univerſQueſt. What Principles do you account thus to be of Natural Religion?Anſw. I account theſe followingQueſt. Do you believe theſe ſo cloſe to, and inſeparable from the Reaſon of Man?Anſw. I am fully aſſQueſt. But would you have Men reſt in Natural Principles, without Revelation?Anſw. No, by no means: Queſt. But does there appear any Expectation of Revelation in the Motions of Natural Reaſon?Anſw. VeQueſt. How happy might the World be, if all the Religions of the World were but reformed to this NatQueſt. But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ſeems to have been no Effect ofQueſt. SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, letQueſt. How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?Anſw. Even they were for ſome conſiderable SQueſt. What Examples are there of Gods continuing Favour to any parts of Mankind, out of Abrahams FaQueſt. How long did the Nations that deſerted God, continue under that diſmal obſcurity?Anſw. Till tQueſt. How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?Anſw. In divers Queſt. How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of himſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?Anſw. Queſt. Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monuments of his Truth given out by Revelation?AnſQueſt. Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?Anſw. Queſt. Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?Queſt. What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guideQueſt. But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the ScripQueſt. It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubtedQueſt. But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Natural Religion to Revealed, or from what he doeQueſt. You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprunQueſt. But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently DivinQueſt. What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, DivinQueſt. I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy Babeliſm, or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenQueſt. What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Diverſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt aQueſt. SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminentQueſt. But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, Queſt. But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; whQueſt. How far, and to what things does the Rule of the Word of God extend?Anſw. To all things, moſtQueſt. Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?AnſwQueſt. WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo DiQueſt. Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is below the DignitQueſt. How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?Anſw. By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Queſt. Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning ScripturesQueſt. What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?Anſw. I account thQueſt. But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, Ʋniverſal Tradition, and Education, in the BQueſt. But is there not much more to be yielded to the Rational Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as tQueſt. But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than Queſt. How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture. Excellency in the ſQueſt. But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Queſt. Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſitory of Sacred Oracles?Anſw. It is ſo in DivinQueſt. Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Queſt. But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the ChQueſt. But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches TeſtimonyQueſt. Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Learned Men, make no Abatement from the CertaintQueſt. THat the Progreſs upon this great Point may be made with the beſt Advantage, it will be neceſQueſt. But hath the Private Spirit of Apoſtate Angels, working by Corrupted Humane Nature, made no AQueſt. How ſhould an Interpretation be ſo made of Scripture, as to partake of its Divineneſs?Anſw. AQueſt. What is the Effect of ſuch Interpretations?Anſw. Every one that ſoberly, and impartially, andQueſt. How elſe may Interpretation be Publick and Divine, even as Scripture it ſelf?Anſw. When thereQueſt. What are to be underſtood to be Motives of Credibility in ſo great a Caſe?Anſw. The Divine SeQueſt. Who were ſuch Interpreters of former Scripture?Anſw. The Prophets were ſuch Interpreters uponQueſt. How did the New Teſtament, and the Writers of it, ſucceed in this great Office of Expounding Queſt. How is this Notion of Publick Interpretation, contradiſtinguiſh'd to Private, made good out oQueſt. But you know the Original Word there uſed, and tranſlated Interpretation, is by ſome underſtoQueſt. What was the Apoſtles Purpoſe? Anſw. To aſſure the Jewiſh Chriſtians in the Truth of ChriſtiaQueſt. Was it not then to the purpoſe, to aſſure the Divine Original of that Word of Propheſie, and Queſt. What was the preciſe Mark the Apoſtle was to aim at?Anſw. To vindicate the true way of InterpQueſt. Why was this ſo much to his purpoſe?Anſw. Becauſe the whole Stream of Interpretation of the OQueſt. Whence came this Current of Falſe Interpretation?Anſw. Even from whence Interpretation might Queſt. How does the Apoſtle vindicate this Point?Anſw. By a vehement Caution on thoſe to whom he vriQueſt. Wherein lies the Strength of this Argument?Anſw. In this: If the Interpretation of Scripture Queſt. Into what Ʋſe and Effect did this Argument iſſue?Anſw. To a ſilent calling them to compare thQueſt. How then did our Saviour and the Apoſtles juſtifie their Interpretation to be Publick and DivQueſt. How could it be proved the Miniſters of the New Teſtament had the true Key of Interpretation Queſt. If then our Lord and his Apoſtles, in Interpreting the Old Teſtament by the immediate PreſencQueſt. But would you have none undertake in the Interpreting or Expounding Scripture, except by InſpQueſt. But how is ſuch Interpretation conſiſtent with the Apoſtles ſo great Aſſertion, That ScripturQueſt. All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record aQueſt. What then is that Private Interpretation the Apoſtle remonſtrates againſt?Anſw. All InterpretQueſt. Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertaQueſt. Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for wQueſt. What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch ScripturesQueſt. Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to PQueſt. Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Matter.Anſw. It reſts in theſe two things.1. ThaQueſt. Hath God wrought miraculouſly to theſe Ends?Anſw. That need not be aſſerted; but he hath, by Queſt. What Viſible Means hath Providence uſed for the ſecuring Scriptures againſt foul Corruptions?Queſt. What care hath God been pleaſed to take with regard to Tranſlations?Anſw. Very eminent, whereQueſt. BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Interpretation appear guarded by their own DivineneQueſt. What is Tradition?Anſw. Theſe four things concur to the making up Tradition.1. That from the Queſt. Who are the great Maſters of Tradition?Anſw. They that have, under the True Religion, ſet up Queſt. What Antidote is there againſt the Miſchief of Tradition?Anſw. To cleave with full purpoſe anQueſt. But is the Senſe that hath now been given of Tradition, the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſeQueſt. Why might not True Religion continue in Tradition, committed all along to Faithful Men, even Queſt. Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, acQueſt. But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and dQueſt. Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?Anſw. This great Reaſon: If we had undouQueſt. But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo fit for vulgar Knowledge, aQueſt. But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Tranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call FQueſt. But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable tQueſt. But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, LeQueſt. And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chriſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of iQueſt. But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from ScriQueſt. Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Councils?Anſw. How many Humanes ſoever meet, they Queſt. But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and dQueſt. SCripture, the Publick Record of Catholick Religion, being thus far Eſtabl••••• and Secured, Queſt. What is to be underſtood by the Church?Anſw. The Church is The Catholick Congregation of MankQueſt. Why do you give the Church the ſtile of a Congregation, are not the Parts of it ſo diſtant thQueſt. But ſtill, how can the Church be called a Congregation, ſeeing that •••aks it always actuallyQueſt. Why do you call the Church, The Congregation?Anſw. Even as Holy Writing is The Scripture, andQueſt. Why is the Church ſaid to be a Congregation called by the Word?Anſw. Becauſe Humane Nature, uQueſt. Why is the Church deſcrib'd to be One Catholick Congregation, when both Scripture and daily OQueſt. How is this Church Congregated?Anſw. It was begun and hath always increaſed by Particular PerQueſt. The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the ChurchQueſt. Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?Anſw. All that are indeed the Church, are ſQueſt. Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?AnQueſt. In what ſenſe is it then ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church?Anſw. IQueſt. How is the Church ordained by God to actuate Scripture, as it is the Secord of Catholick ReliQueſt. Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determQueſt. If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the ImporQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Pillar of Truth? Does the Church ſupport Truth?AnQueſt. How then is it ſaid to be the Pillar of Truth? And of what Importance is that to the ActuatinQueſt. What is the meaning of the Church being the Ground of Truth? And how does this actuate ScriptQueſt. Cannot then the Church fail?Anſw. It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For,Queſt. But is th•re no higher Senſe of the Church being the Pillar and Ground of Truth?Anſw. No otheQueſt. May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour, Thou art Peter,Queſt. Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have beeQueſt. We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not thQueſt. But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly Queſt. What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth iQueſt. How then can it he ſaid, The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?Anſw. That ProphetickQueſt. Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?Anſw. They which are by True Saving Faith uniQueſt. Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?Anſw. They that though they may, as Artificial Pillars,Queſt. How does the Profeſſionary Church fall away in the Bulk and Body of its Profeſſors, and ProfeQueſt. How does this come to paſs?Anſw. From the Judgment of God upon the preſent ſinful State, permQueſt. What becomes of the Profeſſionary Church, when it loſes the True State of a Church?Anſw. It iQueſt. What becomes of it when it is corrupted, and loſes in its Truth?Anſw. It exchanges the LivelyQueſt. How does God deal with ſuch Churches?Anſw. Sometimes ſweeps them with the Beeſom of DeſtructiQueſt. In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?Anſw. God chaQueſt. How is it with them, when the very Place and Candleſtick are taken away?Anſw. They are eitherQueſt. How do they ſurvive in the time of the diſplac'd and dejected Candleſtick?Anſw. They are eithQueſt. How is a Viſible Profeſſion loſt from Particular Perſons?Anſw. It is too often thrown up by AQueſt. What is to be inferred from all this?Anſw. That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, thQueſt. There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Queſt. What is the meaning hereof?Anſw. The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath Queſt. What is a Particular Church?Anſw. It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number ofQueſt. CAn there be either an Orderly, or an Effectual Actuation of the Truth, by the Church as a CoQueſt. What Titles or Characters does the New Teſtament place upon theſe Officers?Anſw. Thoſe that wQueſt. How ſhall the True Miniſters of Chriſt be known, that there may be that Obedience and SubmiſſQueſt. But how are they moſt orderly enſtall'd into ſo high a Function?Anſw. Chriſt as the Head of tQueſt. Is the Lord Chriſt pleaſed then to act generally by the Elders and Officers of the Church?AnſQueſt. I deſire your more full Explanation of the Publick Offices of the Chriſtian Church, and the PQueſt. Wherein ſtood their Power?Anſw. It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, byQueſt. How was this Power Juſtified?Anſw. By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and ReaſonableneſQueſt. Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?Anſw. Whenever that Infallible Guidance waQueſt. Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?Anſw. Evangeliſts, ſuch as were TimothQueſt. Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers?Anſw. They were, inQueſt. From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and iQueſt. Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call Biſhops, Succeſſours to the Apoſtles, in that PreemineQueſt. How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably Queſt. ACcording to all the precedent Accounts of the Church, it ſeems not only reaſonable, but moſtQueſt. How ſhould Men of ſo great Diſadvantages to ſuch High Things be inabled to Judge?Anſw. WiſdomQueſt. What are thoſe Right Means?Anſw. Bowing down our Ears to the Words of the Wiſe; that is, of tQueſt. But are not theſe things ſpoken, and written to the Learned and Elders of the Church, that thQueſt. If this was the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, it is undoubtedly much more ſo of the New?Anſw. IQueſt. But in things of Perplexity, and Doubt, are not Chriſtians bound to ſubmit to the Judgments oQueſt. What is the meaning of that?Anſw. It is this very Thing, that we ſhould receive nothing as DoQueſt. But is it not ſaid, that they that have the Rule over us, watch for our Souls, as they that mQueſt. But were not the Apoſtles, and Prophets, to be Truſted at a higher rate than thus?Anſw No: ThQueſt. But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the MQueſt. FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be deQueſt. What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?Anſw. The Truth of the DoctQueſt. How is the Love of the Church Ʋnited in theſe?Anſw. It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we Queſt. How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?Anſw. Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of itQueſt. Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and Hereſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?AQueſt. Is every different Apprehenſion, and Practice enſuing upon it, though diſtant from Truth, immQueſt. Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an Ʋnion with Truth?Anſw. In thisQueſt. Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?Anſw. That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better Queſt. Is there not another ſort of Schiſm yet to be ſpoken of?Anſw. No other that I can find ſpokenQueſt. Is it not Schiſm, when the Church, or that part of it, wherewith we are converſant, preſcribeQueſt. But what, if beſides theſe meer and ſimple Diſſocations of themſelves, and uſe or non-uſe of Queſt. But ſeeing theſe Contentions are ſo hard to be avoided in the midſt of different Judgments, aQueſt. But may it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that according to the Conſtitution of Church GovernourQueſt. But ſtill the Church being a Society, and the beſt of Societies, it muſt be Subject to the La
      * Queſt. Is there yet any further Reaſon againſt a Power in the Rulers of the Church, for impoſing in things of indifferency under the Names of Decency and Order?
Queſt. What is to be underſtood by Scandal?Anſw. Scandal is a Subject of Diſcourſe of too large a CoQueſt. When the thing is indeed neither Commanded, nor Forbidden by God, how can it be changed by thQueſt. But it ſeems, that a Conſcience only in doubt, might be ſetled by the Advice, Example, and AuQueſt. But are not all Sinnews of Government hereby cut, and diſſolv'd, even of Civil Government; foQueſt. There appears ſo near an Affinity in the Commands concerning Indifferent Things, of thoſe thaQueſt. IS there not an Anti-Church, or Antichriſtian-Church, that ſtands in Oppoſition to the True-CQueſt. With what Advantages hath it been arm'd thus to take upon it ſelf at all the Name of a ChurchQueſt. Having then the Scriptures, thoſe Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Diſcourſes of the AncQueſt. How then did it riſe to ſuch an Eminency and pretence of being Catholick and Publick?Anſw. ThQueſt. Theſe things I confeſs not ſo convenient to my Inquiry; I deſire only to know, how, in the miQueſt. But how did the True-Church in this time Actuate Truth, or agree with thoſe Characters of beiQueſt. How was it with the True-Church recovering it ſelf from this great Darkneſs?Anſw. God raiſed Queſt. Could the Scripture be inconſcious, or ſilent concerning ſo great Revolutions in the Church oQueſt. If you pleaſe, point me to the chief of thoſe places you refer to?Anſw. I will do it very briQueſt. But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confQueſt. What then can be our Invariable Northpole in Religion, in ſuch a Wide and Tumultuous Ocean?AnQueſt. I much deſire to have ſome ſuch Teſt, as you ſeem to intimate and promiſe?Anſw. I cannot furnQueſt. The very General view of ſo rich an Embleme much affects me, but I deſire you to lead me intoQueſt. What do you underſtand by the Foundations, the Wall, the Gates, the City it ſelf?Anſw. I am nQueſt. What are we directed to, by all being reduced to the Number Twelve?Anſw. It is very evident, Queſt. Why are all things in the Chriſtian State deſerib'd to be of Pure Gold, and Precious Pearl?AnQueſt. But can this be ſuppoſed to be the preſent State of the Church of God, as it is here upon EarQueſt. But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being Queſt Will you then more fully explain this Similitude?Anſw. That I may the better do it, I muſt repQueſt. Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?Anſw. Queſt. Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Application of this Parabolick Scheme?Anſw. You ſQueſt. How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?Anſw. In all thQueſt. How is the Falſe Church out of Square to all theſe?Anſw. In that retaining the Profeſſion of Queſt.But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like theQueſt. What then can this pretended Catholick Church be, in relation to the True Catholick Publick RQueſt. How can it be believed, that ſo great a Lie upon Chriſtianity ſhould be received by ſo large Queſt. But it ſeems impoſible, that any parts of the Chriſtian World, that have been once diſabuſed,Queſt. What is the greateſt Security, under the Divine Grace and Providence, againſt ſo great DeſolaQueſt. IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpoken, that the ſettlement of Religion in thQueſt. What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this DoubQueſt. I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all thingsQueſt. I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?Anſw. That ſuch Laws might be Queſt. But how are Princes and Magiſtrates ſecured in the Exerciſe of their Power againſt thoſe thatQueſt. But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear himſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Queſt. Is the Power of Magiſtrates only in thoſe clear and undoubted points of Godlineſs, RighteouſnQueſt. But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in ReliQueſt. I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concerning the Power of Governours in Revealed ReliQueſt. Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the DiſtinctiQueſt. This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what ObedieQueſt. But ought we not to expect, that Princes ſhould be the Supream Interpreters of the Mind and WQueſt. What is to be Inferred from hence?Anſw. Eſpecially, that the Truth of Religion is ſo independQueſt. What other reaſon may there be of Separating the Adminiſtration of Divine Truth from that of Queſt. I deſire you, now to apply your Diſcourſe to the Adminiſtration of Soveraign Powers, in modelQueſt. But this Doubt may extend to Civil Things, and Indifferences there, or to thoſe Rights of SovQueſt. The great Queſtion now remains, what are Subjects to do, when Anthority ſtamps it ſelf upon FQueſt. How then is there a Subjection to Magiſtrates?Anſw. The Subjection then is in this, as in allQueſt. But what are Chriſtian Subjects to do, when Titles of Soveraignty, or Legiſlative, or ExecutiQueſt. The Diſcourſe of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, hath brought to my thoughts, National Queſt. What is the firſt Propoſition I am to be Inſtructed by?Anſw. It is this, That to join in TrueQueſt. I deſire your Second Propoſition?Anſw. It is this, That in a Political Senſe, National ReligiQueſt. I now deſire the Third Propoſition?Anſw. The Government of a Nation in Religion, appointing aQueſt. I now deſire your Fourth Propoſition?Anſw. The Benefit of National Religion Eſtabliſhed by LaQueſt. I deſire your Fifth Propoſition?Anſw. National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Comprehend Queſt. I now expect the laſt Propoſition?Anſw. I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this
